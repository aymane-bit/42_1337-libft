# Libft Project

Welcome to my `libft` project! This project is part of the curriculum at 42, where I've implemented my own library of standard C functions as well as some additional utility functions.

## About the Project

The `libft` project is a fundamental exercise in strengthening my understanding of C programming. It involves re-implementing various standard C library functions, such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked lists. Additionally, I've created some utility functions that I find helpful for future projects.

## Functions Implemented

The library includes, but is not limited to, the following functions:
ft_isalnum.c ft_isalpha.c ft_isascii.c ft_isdigit.c ft_isprint.c ft_memset.c ft_strchr.c ft_strlen.c ft_strncmp.c ft_strnstr.c ft_strjoin.c ft_substr.c ft_tolower.c ft_striteri.c ft_putchar_fd.c ft_putendl_fd.c
ft_strrchr.c ft_toupper.c ft_strlcpy.c ft_atoi.c ft_strlcat.c ft_bzero.c ft_memcpy.c ft_memchr.c ft_memcmp.c ft_strdup.c ft_calloc.c ft_memmove.c ft_split.c ft_itoa.c ft_strmapi.c ft_putstr_fd.c ft_putnbr_fd.c ft_strtrim.c
ft_lstnew_bonus.c ft_lstadd_front_bonus.c ft_lstsize_bonus.c ft_lstlast_bonus.c ft_lstadd_back_bonus.c ft_lstdelone_bonus.c ft_lstclear_bonus.c ft_lstiter_bonus.c ft_lstmap_bonus.c

## How to Use

To use this library in your projects, you can simply include the `libft.h` header file and link your project with the compiled `libft.a` library.


include "libft.h"

int main() {
    // Your code using functions from libft
    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile your program with the libft.a library:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o your_program your_file.c -L. -lft
